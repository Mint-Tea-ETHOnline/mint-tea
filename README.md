# üçµ Mint Tea

Brew up some fresh cross-chain NFTs with the üçµ Mint Tea web3 application. Port your best NFTs to all the top chains to maximise your exposure using our NFT bridge. Mint Tableland NFTs with mutable metadata all stored in relational data tables on chain.

Mint Tea NFT holders can bridge their dynamic NFTs cross-chain to trade, stake or use on different blockchains and their local dapps. We've included a standard bridge using the IOU approach so users can bridge normal tokens or our custom NFTs to the different blockchains.

Search and verify your NFTs for rarity by name, description and image across all chains using NFT Ports api. Search by image url to verify your NFT artworks and images are true before purchasing your favourite works.

Browse through our marketplace to list and trade NFT collections for art, music, game items and so much more.

Mint Tea aims to become a truly cross-chain platform that opens up new markets in the blockchain space. We aim to bridge as many chains as possible starting with Ethereum, Polygon and Optimism. As our core technologies expand then we will grow with them incorporating more chains in the future.

## What is üçµ Mint Tea?

### Let's begin with the Problem

Currently, typical ERC-20 token bridges don't care about the original metadata of a fungible token, but when bridging an ERC-721 NFT, we should always follow the original metadata to uphold the rarity of the non-fungible token.

Usually when you bridge an NFT through a typical bridge, the NFT on the new chain is practically a new one and the bridge follows the mint/burn approach. The big issue is that you can't actually trace that NFT back to the original chain, because when it is bridged, all the other non-vital information like collection name and similar information can be lost in the process. The cross-chain NFT has become a new form of non-fungible token or NFT and deserves a standard of it's own. With recent developments in General Message Passing, if you bridge an NFT, then the dApp on the new chain would be able to trace the cross-chain NFT back to it's chain of origin or minting chain, to make sure that it is actually the correct and true NFT and not a duplicate or fake.

### The Mint Tea Solution

For example, let's say you own an NFT on Ethereum and you take it cross-chain to Avalanche for example. The data of the NFT ‚Äì the collection, the metadata ‚Äì will be carried forwards, meaning that the dApp on Avalanche would be able to confirm that the NFT on Avalanche is indeed coming from Ethereum. This novel solution using General Message Passing opens up unlimited possibilities in the blockchain space. For example, let's say you can use your very valuable Ape NFT on Ethereum as collateral on another blockchain and still hold it's value', or you can create a dApp that utilises NFTs from multiple chains, without worrying about the license or royalty fees problem or similar issues. This new form of NFT deserves further exploration as it opens up many use cases, especially in the gaming industry, music and arts. We believe that by using the Tableland NFT as a building block, soon we will be able to create entire game characters as NFTs and then attached game items, which are also dynamic NFTs that can change over time or skill levels, etc.

## Tableland Example

Tableland is a composable data network that brings SQL to smart contracts on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains. Read and write structured data to the blockchain to supercharge NFTs, games, metaverse experiences, and all of web3.

## ETHOnline Sponsor Tech Used

### Ethereum, Polygon and Optimism

Ethereum is the community-run technology powering the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of decentralized applications.

Polygon believes in Web3 for all. Polygon is a decentralised Ethereum scaling platform that enables developers to build scalable user-friendly dApps with low transaction fees without ever sacrificing on security.

Optimism is a low-cost and lightning-fast Ethereum L2 blockchain.

### Tableland

Tableland is a web3-native database that can be used to store data in relational tables. One of the most exciting use cases is using Tableland for NFT metadata ‚Äî which is a challenging problem in web3, especially for novel dynamic NFT use cases. Developers must make tradeoffs between:

1. Expensive on-chain storage with very limited query-ability
2. Centralized storage, which doesn‚Äôt enable web3 paradigms
3. Decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS), which is great for file/image storage, but immutable files (CIDs) pose a challenge for novel NFT metadata use cases

Tableland solves the web3 metadata problem with ERC721-based tables that are powered by smart contracts. Create, insert, and update tables, all using smart contracts and/or libraries built on top of Tableland smart contracts. The metadata can also be dynamic and change based on user interactions or on-chain events. The Tableland contracts are currently deployed on Polygon mainnet & Mumbai testnet, as well as a number of other chains with more coming soon.

### deBridge

deBridge is a secure interoperability layer for Web3 that enables decentralized transfers of arbitrary messages and value between various blockchains. The validation of cross-chain transactions is performed by a network of independent validators who are elected by and work for deBridge governance. Validators maintain the blockchain infrastructure and each run a deBridge node to sign all transactions that pass through deBridge smart contracts in different blockchains.

Delegated staking and slashing mechanics act as a backbone for protocol security and provide economic disincentives for validators to collude.
The deBridge protocol is an infrastructure platform and a framework for:

1. Decentralized transfer of arbitrary data and assets
2. Cross-chain interoperability and composability of smart contracts
3. Cross-chain swaps
4. Interoperability and bridging of NFTs

Projects can integrate with deBridge infrastructure to tap into the various cross-chain opportunities that the deBridge smart contracts enable. These can for instance be:

- Build own custom bridges for assets and NFTs preserving custom NFT logic (e.g. breeding)
- Enable users from other blockchain ecosystems interact with their protocol (enable global accessibility)
- Scale up their protocol to other chains and exchange commands/messages between components of their protocol
- Make their protocol composable with protocols from other ecosystems
- Build new types of cross-chain applications and primitives
- Enable global accessibility by letting users and protocols from other chains seamlessly interact with the protocol

### NFTPort Enhanced APIs ü¶∏üèª

NFTPort provide core products which make the developer experience as easy as possible and accelerate NFT application development. All of them enable to focus on building the best product for your users, instead of reinventing the NFT infrastructure wheel.

NFTPort provide enhanced APIs for Text Search so you don't have to build your own NFT database, Content NFTID which enables to find similar and duplicate NFTs to increase customer loyalty and an NFT Recommendation Engine to increase revenue.

### IPFS, Filecoin and NFT.Storage

The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralized file system for building the next generation of the internet. Filecoin (opens new window) and many popular Web3 projects are built on IPFS. Some call it the hard drive for blockchain and Web3, though its power extends much further.

NFT.Storage is a long-term storage service designed for off-chain NFT data (like metadata, images, and other assets). Data is content addressed using IPFS, meaning the URI pointing to a piece of data (‚Äúipfs://‚Ä¶‚Äù) is completely unique to that data (using a content identifier, or CID). IPFS URLs and CIDs can be used in NFTs and metadata to ensure the NFT forever actually refers to the intended data (eliminating things like rug pulls, and making it trustlessly verifiable what content an NFT is associated with).
